Email and password in core. A new top-level `emailPassword` config key stores a real email in `users.email` and serves `POST /auth/email/sign-up`, `/sign-in`, `/verify`, `/resend-verification`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` and `/change-password` from `createTheAuthHandler`. It reuses the username credential table, hashing, lockout and sign-in gate, and issues ordinary core sessions with the session cookie. Verification is on by default (it needs `emailVerification`): sign-up creates no session, sign-in answers `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` only after the password checks out, and a sign-up for a taken address answers like a new one and never attaches a password to the existing user. A completed password reset marks the address verified.

Client bindings: `emailPassword: true` on the session store, React `managed`, the Vue plugin, the Svelte client, the Expo provider config and the Electron provider points them at the new routes. Sign-up now reports `verificationRequired`, failed results carry the server `code`, and the store, React (`useEmailPassword`), Vue and Svelte expose `verifyEmail`, `resendVerification`, `requestPasswordReset` and `resetPassword`. React `signUp` resolves to `data: { verificationRequired }` instead of `data: undefined`. `@glinr/theauth-react` also splits `context.tsx` into smaller files with no behavior change.

Fixes: `emailVerification` alone no longer fails with "no such table" (the one-time token table is now created for it). `@glinr/theauth-email` is deprecated: its sign-in token is not a core session (`GET /auth/session` answers 401, no cookie is set) and its sign-up returned a session token before verification. Use `emailPassword`.
