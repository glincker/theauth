# @glinr/theauth-express

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- TheAuth is now the canonical naming across the SDK (`TheAuthClient`,
  `TheAuthProvider`, `TheAuthError`, `createTheAuth`, and per-adapter
  equivalents like `theAuthExpress`/`theAuthHono`). This resolves a
  three-way naming collision: an earlier pass renamed `Kavach*` to `Auth*`,
  this pass supersedes that with `TheAuth*` as canonical.

  Non-breaking. Both `Auth*` and `Kavach*` names remain as deprecated
  aliases pointing at the same implementation and will keep working until
  a future major version. No behavior changed, only naming.

  Also fixes two adapters (`express`, `hono`) that were missed by the
  earlier `Auth*` rename entirely and still only exported `kavach`-prefixed
  names.

### Major Changes

- 94804ec: Launch wave B: explicit major alignment for adapters/plugins after core moves to the 0.1 line.

  Why major:

  - These packages are pre-1.0 and depend on core package version semantics.
  - Core 0.0.x -> 0.1.x is treated as breaking for dependent package versioning.

  Operator notes:

  - Publish this wave separately from the core/client 0.1.0 wave.
  - Keep `@glinr/theauth-dashboard` on its independent track.
