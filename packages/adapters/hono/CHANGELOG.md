# @glinr/theauth-hono

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1fa2338: Scope management routes to the signed in owner when the default guard is used. With the default session resolver, `/agents`, `/delegations`, `/audit`, `/dashboard` and `POST /authorize` only act on the caller's own agents, delegations and audit rows, and `POST /agents` requires `ownerId` to be the caller. A custom `authenticate` resolver behaves as before. Core adds `guard.resolve()` and the `AdapterScope` helper so the other adapters can adopt the same checks, and `audit.export()` accepts a `userId` filter.
- 1fa2338: Resolve the client IP through the trusted proxy helper. The hono and express adapters no longer read `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP` directly. By default forwarded headers are ignored (Express still falls back to `req.ip`), so an `ipAllowlist` constraint denies when the IP is unknown. Pass `trustedProxy: { trustedProxyCount }` or `trustedProxy: { trustedHeader }` to the adapter to match your proxy setup.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4e37e17: Security: the framework adapters no longer serve the management routes anonymously.

  BREAKING (adapters): `/agents`, `/delegations`, `/audit`, `/dashboard` and `POST /authorize` now require an authenticated caller. Pass `authenticate: (request) => ({ id }) | null` to the adapter, or configure `auth.session` on `createTheAuth` to accept any valid session. With neither, the adapter throws when it is created. For local development only, `allowUnauthenticated: true` restores the old behavior and logs a warning. `/authorize/token`, MCP, password reset, email verification and plugin routes are unchanged.

  Other fixes:

  - hono and fastify: plugin routes now work when the adapter is mounted under a prefix (`app.route("/x", theAuthHono(...))`, `register(plugin, { prefix })`) instead of returning 404.
  - core: `plugins: [magicLink(...)]` (and the email OTP, 2FA, passkey, API key and organization plugins) now create their tables, matching the config-key form.
  - core: new `createAdapterGuard` and `isProtectedAdapterPath` exports used by every adapter.
  - create-theauth-app: templates pin `@glinr/*` packages to the versions in this release instead of stale ranges, list `sql.js` (the driver behind `provider: "sqlite"`) and `zod`, and the hono-mcp template protects its management routes with an `ADMIN_API_KEY`. The next-saas catch-all route now passes the TheAuth instance to the adapter.

## 4.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 0fa5b1e: Remove the legacy KavachOS naming. The deprecated `Kavach*` and `createKavach` exports are gone: use `TheAuth*` and `createTheAuth`. Environment variables are now `THEAUTH_*`, webhook headers `X-TheAuth-*`, cookies and the default API route use `theauth`, and database tables are `theauth_*` (existing `kavach_*` tables are renamed in place by `createTables`, no data is lost). `Auth*` aliases remain deprecated.

### Patch Changes

- 960fe89: Delegation requests whose permissions are not a subset of the parent's now return HTTP 400 with error code `DELEGATION_PERMISSION_SUBSET` instead of a 500. Core throws a typed `DelegationError` (codes `DELEGATION_PERMISSION_SUBSET` and `DELEGATION_DEPTH_EXCEEDED`) and every REST adapter maps it to a 400 using that code.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- TheAuth is now the canonical naming across the SDK (`TheAuthClient`,
  `TheAuthProvider`, `TheAuthError`, `createTheAuth`, and per-adapter
  equivalents like `theAuthExpress`/`theAuthHono`). This resolves a
  three-way naming collision: an earlier pass renamed `Kavach*` to `Auth*`,
  this pass supersedes that with `TheAuth*` as canonical.

  Non-breaking. Both `Auth*` and `Kavach*` names remain as deprecated
  aliases pointing at the same implementation and will keep working until
  a future major version. No behavior changed, only naming.

  Also fixes two adapters (`express`, `hono`) that were missed by the
  earlier `Auth*` rename entirely and still only exported `kavach`-prefixed
  names.

### Major Changes

- 94804ec: Launch wave B: explicit major alignment for adapters/plugins after core moves to the 0.1 line.

  Why major:

  - These packages are pre-1.0 and depend on core package version semantics.
  - Core 0.0.x -> 0.1.x is treated as breaking for dependent package versioning.

  Operator notes:

  - Publish this wave separately from the core/client 0.1.0 wave.
  - Keep `@glinr/theauth-dashboard` on its independent track.
