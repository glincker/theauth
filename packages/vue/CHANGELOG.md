# @glinr/theauth-vue

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- TheAuth is now the canonical naming across the SDK (`TheAuthClient`,
  `TheAuthProvider`, `TheAuthError`, `createTheAuth`, and per-adapter
  equivalents like `theAuthExpress`/`theAuthHono`). This resolves a
  three-way naming collision: an earlier pass renamed `Kavach*` to `Auth*`,
  this pass supersedes that with `TheAuth*` as canonical.

  Non-breaking. Both `Auth*` and `Kavach*` names remain as deprecated
  aliases pointing at the same implementation and will keep working until
  a future major version. No behavior changed, only naming.

  Also fixes two adapters (`express`, `hono`) that were missed by the
  earlier `Auth*` rename entirely and still only exported `kavach`-prefixed
  names.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 94804ec: Launch release: promote core and primary client-facing packages to the 0.1 line.

  Highlights:

  - Stabilize package exports and build artifacts for launch.
  - Ship improved CLI version handling and launch docs.
  - Keep adapters/plugins/dashboard on existing release tracks for a separate coordinated versioning pass.
