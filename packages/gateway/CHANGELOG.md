# @glinr/theauth-gateway

## 4.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 0fa5b1e: Remove the legacy KavachOS naming. The deprecated `Kavach*` and `createKavach` exports are gone: use `TheAuth*` and `createTheAuth`. Environment variables are now `THEAUTH_*`, webhook headers `X-TheAuth-*`, cookies and the default API route use `theauth`, and database tables are `theauth_*` (existing `kavach_*` tables are renamed in place by `createTables`, no data is lost). `Auth*` aliases remain deprecated.

### Patch Changes

- c2b5daf: The gateway CLI now enables agents when it creates its TheAuth instance, so a fresh database gets the agent, audit and related tables at startup and the first agent call no longer fails with "no such table". The legacy table rename step in core is unchanged.

### Major Changes

- 94804ec: Launch wave B: explicit major alignment for adapters/plugins after core moves to the 0.1 line.

  Why major:

  - These packages are pre-1.0 and depend on core package version semantics.
  - Core 0.0.x -> 0.1.x is treated as breaking for dependent package versioning.

  Operator notes:

  - Publish this wave separately from the core/client 0.1.0 wave.
  - Keep `@glinr/theauth-dashboard` on its independent track.

- Updated dependencies [94804ec]
  - theauth@0.1.0
