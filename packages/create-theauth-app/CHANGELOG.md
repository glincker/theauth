# @glinr/create-theauth-app

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e37e17: Security: the framework adapters no longer serve the management routes anonymously.

  BREAKING (adapters): `/agents`, `/delegations`, `/audit`, `/dashboard` and `POST /authorize` now require an authenticated caller. Pass `authenticate: (request) => ({ id }) | null` to the adapter, or configure `auth.session` on `createTheAuth` to accept any valid session. With neither, the adapter throws when it is created. For local development only, `allowUnauthenticated: true` restores the old behavior and logs a warning. `/authorize/token`, MCP, password reset, email verification and plugin routes are unchanged.

  Other fixes:

  - hono and fastify: plugin routes now work when the adapter is mounted under a prefix (`app.route("/x", theAuthHono(...))`, `register(plugin, { prefix })`) instead of returning 404.
  - core: `plugins: [magicLink(...)]` (and the email OTP, 2FA, passkey, API key and organization plugins) now create their tables, matching the config-key form.
  - core: new `createAdapterGuard` and `isProtectedAdapterPath` exports used by every adapter.
  - create-theauth-app: templates pin `@glinr/*` packages to the versions in this release instead of stale ranges, list `sql.js` (the driver behind `provider: "sqlite"`) and `zod`, and the hono-mcp template protects its management routes with an `ADMIN_API_KEY`. The next-saas catch-all route now passes the TheAuth instance to the adapter.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0fa5b1e: Remove the legacy KavachOS naming. The deprecated `Kavach*` and `createKavach` exports are gone: use `TheAuth*` and `createTheAuth`. Environment variables are now `THEAUTH_*`, webhook headers `X-TheAuth-*`, cookies and the default API route use `theauth`, and database tables are `theauth_*` (existing `kavach_*` tables are renamed in place by `createTables`, no data is lost). `Auth*` aliases remain deprecated.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the `hono-mcp` template. Scaffolds a Hono server that mounts the TheAuth auth routes and the MCP OAuth 2.1 surface under `/api`, with `/tools/list` and `/tools/call/:name` behind `authorizeByToken` or MCP JWT validation. Complements the existing `next-saas` template with an agent-first starter.

  The `expo-mobile` template stays behind its placeholder.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: v3 wave

  - Agentic JWT claim constants (`AGENTIC_JWT_CLAIMS`) from `draft-goswami-agentic-jwt-00` and `draft-liu-agent-operation-authorization-01`, behind a new `emitAgenticJwtClaims` config flag. Populates `agent_id`, `agent_type`, and `trust_tier` on issued tokens when on. Off by default.
  - Ten OAuth providers (Notion, Spotify, Discord, Slack, Twitch, Reddit, Figma, Dropbox, Zoom, Atlassian) promoted to first-class named exports with typed factories, `DEFAULT_X_SCOPES` constants, and profile normalisers.
  - `exportAuditAsVC` in `@glinr/theauth/vc` for compliance audit exports as W3C Verifiable Credentials (`ldp_vc` or `jwt_vc`, individual or Verifiable Presentation).
  - Initial `@glinr/create-theauth-app` scaffolder on npm with a Next.js App Router template.
